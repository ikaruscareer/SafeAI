"""SafeAI Security Scorecard: deterministic, transparent, auditable scoring.

The scorecard is a Scorecard-style report (not an OpenSSF Scorecard report)
that summarises a SafeAI scan into an overall 0-10 score, per-category
scores, and a pass/warn/fail policy outcome. All scoring rules are
auditable and deterministic: identical findings always produce the same
scorecard.

Design:

- Severity weights: critical=4.0, high=2.0, medium=0.75, low=0.25, info=0.0.
- Diminishing returns for repeated findings from the same rule and location
  (a repeated pattern contributes less after the first occurrence).
- Duplicate fingerprints are treated as a single finding (deduplicated).
- The final score is normalized to the 0-10 range and clamped.
- Skipped or unavailable analyzers are never treated as successful checks;
  they are reported under ``coverage.analyzers_skipped``.
- Suppressed findings keep their ``suppressed`` status but do not affect
  the score (they are excluded from gating).
- Baseline-resolved findings are not present in the current finding set and
  therefore do not affect the score; only ``new``/``existing``/``regressed``
  findings do.
