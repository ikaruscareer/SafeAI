"""Static validation of the release workflow's security posture.

Asserts on `.github/workflows/release.yml` (parsed, not executed):
every third-party action pinned to an immutable commit SHA, no mutable
refs, the Cosign version explicitly pinned, and a fail-closed signature
verification stage between signing and asset preparation.
